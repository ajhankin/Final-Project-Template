Global warming is affecting many aspects of our planet. This project was conducted to analyze what is happening to Arctic sea ice and compare the rate of sea ice concentration change from two different decades. By looking at the change with both mathmatecal and visual analysis we can make a correlation to the rate of which our earth it warming. The results concluded that from 2010-2020 there was a larger decrease in sea ice concentration along with larger variations over time in comparison to 1990-2000 sea ice concentration.
